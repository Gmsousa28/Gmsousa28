About Me:
Hey! I'm Gonçalo Sousa 

- I’m currently studying Medical Informatics Engineering at university.
- I’m learning and practicing C, C#, Python, and SQL, focusing on improving problem-solving and programming logic.
- I’d like to collaborate on simple projects or study groups to learn with others.
- I’m looking for help with organizing projects better and with developer networking, such as Discord communities.
- Feel free to ask me about my learning journey — I enjoy sharing what I learn along the way.
- Fun fact: I love cycling and I usually code while listening to music 🎧.
